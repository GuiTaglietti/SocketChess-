# C++ Chess Game with Socket Communication

Welcome! This project is an advanced implementation of the classic game of chess in C++, featuring socket communication for multiplayer gameplay between two computers. Whether you're a chess enthusiast looking for a challenging opponent or a C++ developer interested in exploring advanced programming concepts, this project offers an exciting playground for learning and enjoyment.

## Features

- **Sophisticated Chess Engine**: Our implementation includes a powerful chess engine capable of handling complex game logic, including move generation, legality checking and more.
- **Socket Communication**: Players can engage in multiplayer chess matches over a network, enabling real-time gameplay between two computers.
- **Documentation and Testing**: Comprehensive documentation and unit tests ensure the reliability, maintainability, and scalability of our codebase.

## Getting Started
